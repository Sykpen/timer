Inside pages you can find example of usage.

1. For install it inside your application, you need next packages (grab the package version from the package.json file):

```json
"axios": "^v",
"next": "^v",
"react": "^v",
"react-dom": "^v",
```

And optional, for sending data:

```json
"react-hook-form": "^v"
```

2. Copy the module folder inside your modules folder, and rename it/
3. Change types if you need, and customise the UI of the component, inside the components folder.
4. Import component and use the polls hook from the hooks folder inside your component, like it's implemented inside the pages folder

**P.S.** You can move the useInterval hooks to your hooks, or use your own insted of this. If you make it in the last way - remove it from the module folder.
